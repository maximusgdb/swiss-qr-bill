To include the generated SVG file in your invoice template in NetSuite, you can follow these general steps:

Store the SVG Markup in a Custom Field:
When your scheduled script or web service generates the SVG (or when you generate it in any other process), save the SVG markup in a custom field on the invoice record (for example, a field with the internal ID custbody_qr_code).

Prepare Your Advanced PDF/HTML Template:
In NetSuite’s Advanced PDF/HTML templates (which use FreeMarker syntax), you can reference the custom field to embed the SVG directly into your PDF output.
Important: The SVG content you generated includes an XML declaration (<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>). Many PDF rendering engines (such as the one NetSuite uses) may have issues when an XML declaration is present in inline markup. It’s best to remove this line before embedding.

Embed the SVG Markup in the Template:
In your template, use FreeMarker to output the SVG. For example, you might include something like the following in your template:

<#-- Check if the QR code field has content -->
<#if record.custbody_qr_code?has_content>
    <#-- Remove the XML declaration if present -->
    <#assign svgContent = record.custbody_qr_code?replace("<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>", "")>
    ${svgContent?html}
</#if>
